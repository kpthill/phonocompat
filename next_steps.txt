1) debug the data issues with arabic, mandarin and probably others
2) move the main table to react
3) move the whole thing to react with a bunch of subcomponents
4) add the non-plosive consonants like w, clicks
5) add a title
6) clean up css, look into using material design or bootstrap or something like that
7) color rows of the table based on compatibility
8) give suggested conlangs
9) consider adding aspiration as a distinctive feature

maybe:
- add support for affricates, ejectives, and other multicharacter consonants
- create a compatibility metric
  - add tips on which sounds can sub for others
